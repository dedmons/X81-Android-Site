          h3 Overview
          p
            |This application is the start to a secure note taking
            |and sharing platform. In this version the user creation,
            |authentication, and note creation is implemented on top
            |of an SQLite database. User passwords are secured using AES512
            |encryption and encoded in Base64 for storage. The master key
            |is derived from the devices unique id.
          p
            |The user registration screen puts the password through simple check
            |and makes sure the confirmation is correct. The login screen gives
            |error feedback based on your input and the data in the database.
          p
            |Notes are stored based on the user who creates them.
          h4 New in version 4
          p
            |User accounts are stored on a server and login in against that server.
            |Also adds framework to intigrate other parts of the app with the web server.
          p
            |The server uses codeigniter to create a rest interface, and all communication
            |is done via JSON and HTTP requests.
