          h3 Overview
          p
            |This application is the start to a secure note taking
            |and sharing platform. In this version the user creation,
            |authentication, and note creation is implemented on top
            |of an SQLite database. User passwords are secured using AES512
            |encryption and encoded in Base64 for storage. The master key
            |is derived from the devices unique id.
          p
            |The user registration screen puts the password through simple check
            |and makes sure the confirmation is correct. The login screen gives
            |error feedback based on your input and the data in the database.
          p
            |Notes are stored based on the user who creates them.
          h4 New in version 2
          p
            |You can now edit the notes body. When you create a note you are taken
            |to the edit screen, and when you tap on an entry in the list view you
            |are taken to the edit view to edit the note.
          p
            |Also added Toast views to inform use to action happening in the application,
            |and changed cryptogriphy scheme so old data will not work with the new version.
